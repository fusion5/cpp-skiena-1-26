A GUI to define points and to compute a shortest tour between them. 
It uses 2 basic, greedy algorithms [1] (from algorithms.cxx) for now:
- closest pairs: pick the closest chain ends that exist and connect them 
  with an edge. Begin with all vertices being a 1-vertex chain.
- closest next point: after the current point is visited, pick the next 
  unvisited point that is closest to it. Repeat until all points are visited. 

To find the closest point, the algorithms traverse all existing points; but
a more efficient Voronoi diagram could be precomputed, which would give us more
speed.
