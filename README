A GUI to define points and to compute a shortest tour between them. 
It uses 2 basic, greedy algorithms (from algorithms.cxx) for now:
- closest pairs: pick the closest chain ends that exist and connect them 
  with an edge. Begin with all vertices being a 1-vertex chain.
- closest next point: after the current point is visited, pick the next 
  unvisited point that is closest to it. Repeat until all points are visited. 
- other, more efficient algorithms might be implemented in the future.

To compute the closest point, the algorithm traverses all unvisited points; but
a more efficient Voronoi diagram could be precomputed which would give us more
speed.
