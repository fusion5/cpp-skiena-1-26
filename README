A GUI to define points and to compute a shortest tour between them. 
It uses a very basic, greedy algorithm for now, always choosing the closest 
point as the next one, but other algorithms might be implemented in the future.

To compute the closest point, the algorithm traverses all unvisited points; but
a more efficient Voronoi diagram could be precomputed which would give us more
speed.
